# Build Your Bookshelf

## About

The bookshelf you begin building for the first time as an independent person can be deeply personal. You may buy yourself new books to read for the first time or old books that are familiar friends to keep close by. You may buy coffee-table book with beautiful graphics to display front and centre. You might happen into book ownership through gifts to you or assigned required reading; the books may be second-hand tatters, signed copies, or new editions. Even for those who aren't self-described bookworms, a bookshelf can be a object of heartfelt comfort and pride.

Emulating this lifelong accumulative experience, Build Your Bookshelf is a tool for you to virtually build an ideal bookshelf that speaks to the person you are today.

## Project notes

- Aside from personal bookshelf, potential "share a shelf" feature. Create a shelf of books and get a link to share. Like book lists but more visually interesting.
- In lieu of a database of book spines, algorithms to generate book spines in different styles with title, author, possibly publisher. Proposed styles: cover crop, cover with blur, dominant colour, vintage style, embellished floral style, dark style. Ability to choose style for each book or one style with randomness for entire bookshelf.
- Ability to arrange books around bookshelf (including stacked) â€“ ability to automatically sort by genre/author/colour?
