# Build Your Bookshelf

## About

The bookshelf you begin building for the first time as an independent person can be deeply personal. You may buy yourself new books to read for the first time or old books that are familiar friends to keep close by. You may buy coffee-table book with beautiful graphics to display front and centre. You might happen into book ownership through gifts to you or assigned required reading; the books may be second-hand tatters, signed copies, or new editions. Even for those who aren't self-described bookworms, a bookshelf can be a object of heartfelt comfort and pride.

Emulating this lifelong accumulative experience, Build Your Bookshelf is a tool for you to virtually build an ideal bookshelf that speaks to the person you are today.

*A stack of books ranging in genre from fiction, poetry, memoir, politics, art, economics, education, and more*

## Project notes

- Aside from personal bookshelf, potential "share a shelf" feature. Create a shelf of books and get a link to share. Like book lists but more visually interesting.
- In lieu of a database of book spines, algorithms to generate book spines in different styles with title, author, possibly publisher. Ability to choose style for each book or one style with randomness for entire bookshelf. Possible styles:
    + [x] Dominant colour
    + [x] Colours with gradient
    + [x] Cover crop
    + [x] Cover with blur
    + [ ] Vintage style
    + [ ] Embellished floral style
    + [ ] Dark style
- Ability to automatically sort by genre/author/colour?
- "Shelfie" â€“ how your ideal bookshelf shifts as your sense of self changes
- Ability to take/upload pictures and add through image recognition, e.g. from out at library or bookshelf
- Sections of a bookshelf, cataloguing/classification systems
- Ability to arrange/display books in different ways: lined up horizontally, stacked in a pile, spotlighted (cover)
